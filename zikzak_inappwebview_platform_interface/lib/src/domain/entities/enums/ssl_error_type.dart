  ///This value indicates that evaluation reached an (implicitly trusted) anchor certificate without any evaluation failures,

  ///
  ///This value indicates that you should not trust the chain as is,

  ///such as ignoring expired certificates or adding another anchor to the set of trusted anchors.
  ///
  ///The way you handle this depends on the situation.
  ///For example, if you are performing signature validation and you know when the message was originally received,
  ///you should check again using that date to see if the message was valid when you originally received it.

  ///Trust is denied and no simple fix is available.
  ///
  ///This value indicates that evaluation failed because a certificate in the chain is defective.
  ///This usually represents a fundamental defect in the certificate data, such as an invalid encoding for a critical subjectAltName extension,
  ///an unsupported critical extension, or some other critical portion of the certificate that couldn’t be interpreted.

  ///
  ///This value indicates that evaluation failed for some other reason.
