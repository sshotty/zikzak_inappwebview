## Phase 7: TDD remediation (verification @ 90f2d9ce — verdict FAIL)

The feature is NOT done until the untested criteria (SC-001/002/003/006/007) get tests;
that work is already tracked as T001–T020 (planning), T021–T041 (implementation),
T042–T071 (verify), and T072–T091 (cycle kickoffs). Two concrete findings fall outside
that enumeration:

- [ ] **T092** [F3] Wire `redactRequest`/`redactResponse`/`redactBody` through `NetworkCaptureManager._onJavaScriptEvent` and add an integration test proving redaction is applied before raw callbacks/collector. Also implement `redactBody` body-content redaction — it is currently a pass-through stub at `secret_redactor.dart:111`. Proof: `zikzak_inappwebview/test/` integration test asserts a planted token is absent from the manager's emitted events.
- [ ] **T093** [F3] Add outer-loop acceptance verification for A10–A15 (Phase-3 tasks T051–T055 are unticked: no integration test exercises them through the live capture path). Proof: `cd zikzak_inappwebview/example && flutter test integration_test/...` against a headless capture session shows budgets/redaction hold end-to-end.
