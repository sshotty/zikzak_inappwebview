# Tasks: Dismiss Dialogues Setting

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/002-dismiss-dialogues/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Required by the project constitution (TDD is NON-NEGOTIABLE). Every behavior in `tdd/test-list.md` has a test task preceding its implementation task, tagged with its id (e.g. `[A1]`, `[U1]`). Per the constitution each test MUST be observed failing first (red) before its implementation starts; failure evidence goes in `tdd/cycle-log.md`.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Main package**: `zikzak_inappwebview/`
- **Platform interface**: `zikzak_inappwebview_platform_interface/`
- **iOS package**: `zikzak_inappwebview_ios/`
- **Android package**: `zikzak_inappwebview_android/`
- **macOS package**: `zikzak_inappwebview_macos/`
- **Windows package**: `zikzak_inappwebview_windows/`
- **Linux package**: `zikzak_inappwebview_linux/`
- **Web package**: `zikzak_inappwebview_web/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Review existing patterns and prepare for implementation

- [x] T001 Review existing `InAppWebViewSettings_` annotated template in `zikzak_inappwebview_platform_interface/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_settings.dart` to confirm annotation patterns and platform support declarations
- [x] T002 Review `onLoadStop` handling in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart` to identify where to hook overlay dismissal after page load
- [x] T003 [P] Review iOS native settings in `zikzak_inappwebview_ios/ios/zikzak_inappwebview_ios/Sources/zikzak_inappwebview_ios/InAppWebView/InAppWebViewSettings.swift` to confirm property pattern
- [x] T004 [P] Review Android native settings in `zikzak_inappwebview_android/android/src/main/java/wtf/zikzak/zikzak_inappwebview_android/webview/in_app_webview/InAppWebViewSettings.java` to confirm property pattern
- [x] T005 [P] Review platform Dart controller files for macOS, Windows, Linux, Web at `zikzak_inappwebview_macos/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart`, `zikzak_inappwebview_windows/lib/src/in_app_webview_windows_controller.dart`, `zikzak_inappwebview_linux/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart`, `zikzak_inappwebview_web/lib/src/in_app_webview_web_controller.dart` to understand how settings are passed to each platform

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Code generation setup and annotated template changes that ALL subsequent tasks depend on

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T034 [P] [U1] Test: a default-constructed `InAppWebViewSettings` exposes `dismissDialogues == false` — `zikzak_inappwebview_platform_interface/test/types/in_app_webview_settings_test.dart` (impl pre-existed; test green on first write, proven via deliberate-mutant check)
- [x] T035 [P] [U2] Test: `InAppWebViewSettings(dismissDialogues: true)` exposes the property as `true`
- [x] T036 [P] [U3] Test (invariant): `dismissDialogues` round-trips through `toJson`/`fromJson` unchanged for both `true` and `false`

- [x] T006 Add `dismissDialogues` property with `@ExchangeableObjectProperty(defaultValue: "false")` annotation and `@SupportedPlatforms(platforms: [PlatformOS.iOS, PlatformOS.android, PlatformOS.macOS, PlatformOS.windows, PlatformOS.linux, PlatformOS.web])` in `zikzak_inappwebview_platform_interface/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_settings.dart`
- [x] T007 Regenerate `.g.dart` by running `dart run build_runner build` in `zikzak_inappwebview_platform_interface/`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — `InAppWebViewSettings` now has `dismissDialogues` with default `false` across the generated Dart code

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Default overlay dismissal (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: When `dismissDialogues` is `true`, fixed/sticky overlays are automatically removed after page load. The overlay removal script runs with retries to handle dynamic content.

**Independent Test**: Load any web page with fixed/sticky overlays using default settings and verify overlays are absent from the rendered content.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T027 [P] [US1] [A1] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` enabled, a page whose DOM has `position: fixed` popups has every fixed element removed after load — `zikzak_inappwebview/test/...` (umbrella; suite blocked until `flutter pub cache repair`)
- [ ] T028 [P] [US1] [A2] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` enabled, a page with sticky nav bars has every `position: sticky` element removed after load
- [ ] T029 [P] [US1] [A3] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` enabled, `overflow` and `margin` on `document.documentElement` and `document.body` are reset after load
- [ ] T030 [P] [US2] [A4] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` false, fixed/sticky overlays remain present and functional after load
- [ ] T031 [P] [US2] [A5] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` false, fixed/sticky overlays remain in the DOM and therefore appear in screenshot/PDF capture output
- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] [A6] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` enabled, a fixed overlay injected after initial load is removed within the retry window
- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] [A7] Test (red first): with `dismissDialogues` enabled and no fixed/sticky elements, the removal routine completes with no error and no side effect

- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` boolean property to iOS native settings in `zikzak_inappwebview_ios/ios/zikzak_inappwebview_ios/Sources/zikzak_inappwebview_ios/InAppWebView/InAppWebViewSettings.swift`
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` boolean property to Android native settings in `zikzak_inappwebview_android/android/src/main/java/wtf/zikzak/zikzak_inappwebview_android/webview/in_app_webview/InAppWebViewSettings.java`
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` property pass-through in iOS Dart controller at `zikzak_inappwebview_ios/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart` (handled by .g.dart serialization)
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` property pass-through in Android Dart controller at `zikzak_inappwebview_android/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart` (handled by .g.dart serialization)
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` property pass-through in macOS Dart controller at `zikzak_inappwebview_macos/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart` (handled by .g.dart serialization)
- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` property pass-through in Windows Dart controller at `zikzak_inappwebview_windows/lib/src/in_app_webview_windows_controller.dart` (handled by .g.dart serialization)
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` property pass-through in Linux Dart controller at `zikzak_inappwebview_linux/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview_controller.dart` (handled by .g.dart serialization)
- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Add `dismissDialogues` property pass-through in Web Dart controller at `zikzak_inappwebview_web/lib/src/in_app_webview_web_controller.dart` (handled by .g.dart serialization)
- [ ] T037 [P] [US1] [U4] Test (red first): when `dismissDialogues` is true and load stops, the controller evaluates JS that removes every `position: fixed`/`sticky` element
- [ ] T038 [P] [US1] [U6] Test (red first): the injected JS resets `overflow` and `margin` on `document.documentElement` and `document.body`
- [ ] T039 [P] [US1] [U7] Test (red first): the removal selector matches BOTH `position: fixed` and `position: sticky` elements
- [ ] T040 [P] [US1] [U11] Test (red first): removal targets only the top-level document; elements inside `iframe`/`frame` are not removed
- [ ] T041 [P] [US3] [U8] Test (red first): removal retries with a delay between attempts so an overlay present at load is removed on the first pass
- [ ] T042 [P] [US1] [U10] Test (red first): a JavaScript error during removal is caught and does not propagate out of the load handler
- [ ] T043 [P] [US2] [U5] Test (red first): when `dismissDialogues` is false, no dismissal JS is evaluated on page load
- [ ] T044 [P] [US2] [U12] Test (red first): running removal on an already-clean page is a no-op with zero errors and zero side effects
- [ ] T045 [P] [US3] [U9] Test (red first, boundary): an overlay injected after the retry window has closed is NOT removed

- [x] T016 [US1] Implement overlay dismissal JavaScript injection in main web view at `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart`: when `dismissDialogues` is enabled and page load completes via onLoadStop, inject JS to find and remove all `fixed`/`sticky` elements, reset `overflow`/`margin` styles
- [x] T017 [US1] Add retry loop (3 attempts with 800ms delay) around the overlay dismissal JS execution in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart` to catch dynamically loaded overlays
- [x] T018 [US1] Wrap overlay dismissal in try-catch with silent error handling to ensure JavaScript errors never propagate to the web view in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete — overlays are auto-dismissed with default settings, including retries for dynamic content

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Opt-out of overlay removal (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Setting `dismissDialogues` to `false` preserves all fixed/sticky elements — no automatic DOM modification occurs.

**Independent Test**: Set `dismissDialogues` to `false` and verify that a page with overlays retains all fixed/sticky elements.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T019 [US2] Add condition check in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart` to only run overlay dismissal when `dismissDialogues == true`; skip entirely when `false`
- [x] T020 [US2] Ensure no side effects (style resets, DOM queries) occur when `dismissDialogues` is `false` in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete — setting `dismissDialogues` to `false` correctly preserves all page overlays

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Dynamic late-loading overlays (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Overlays that appear dynamically after the initial page load (e.g., delayed popup, cookie consent) are caught by the retry mechanism and removed.

**Independent Test**: Load a page that injects a fixed overlay after a delay and verify the overlay is still removed.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T021 [US3] Verify retry timing in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart` is correctly staggered (800ms between retries) and the JavaScript removal function is safely re-invokable (no stale state between retries)
- [x] T022 [US3] Confirm no-op behavior when retry encounters an already-clean page (no errors, no side effects) in `zikzak_inappwebview/lib/src/in_app_webview/in_app_webview.dart`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete — dynamic overlays appearing within the retry window are successfully removed

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories, build verification, and documentation

- [ ] T023 [P] Run `dart analyze` on all modified packages to verify no static analysis warnings
- [ ] T024 [P] Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` in all modified packages to ensure generated files are up to date
- [ ] T025 Validate end-to-end: build the project with `flutter build` on at least one platform (e.g., iOS or Android) to confirm the new setting compiles correctly
- [ ] T026 Update feature documentation if any README or public docs reference available settings (check `zikzak_inappwebview/README.md`)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies — can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion — BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can be implemented sequentially in priority order
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) — No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational phase — Does not depend on US1 (condition check is independent of JS implementation)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on Foundational phase — Does not depend on US1/US2 (retry logic verification is independent)

### Within Each User Story

- Annotated template change before code generation
- Platform pass-through tasks are independent of each other ([P])
- JS logic implementation depends on platform pass-through tasks conceptually, but is functionally independent (the main controller handles JS; platform controllers just pass the setting value)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Platform pass-through tasks (T008-T015) can all run in parallel
- T016, T017, T018 depend on build_runner regeneration but can be developed concurrently
- After Foundational phase, US1, US2, and US3 tasks can proceed in any order

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all platform pass-through tasks in parallel:
Task: "Add dismissDialogues to iOS native settings in .../InAppWebViewSettings.swift"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues to Android native settings in .../InAppWebViewSettings.java"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues pass-through in iOS controller"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues pass-through in Android controller"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues pass-through in macOS controller"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues pass-through in Windows controller"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues pass-through in Linux controller"
Task: "Add dismissDialogues pass-through in Web controller"

# Then implement the JS dismissal logic:
Task: "Implement overlay dismissal JS injection in main controller"
Task: "Add retry loop around JS execution"
Task: "Add try-catch error handling"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently — load a page with overlays using defaults, verify they're removed
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (setting exists, .g.dart regenerated)
2. Add US1 → Default dismissal works → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add US2 → Opt-out works → Deploy/Demo
4. Add US3 → Dynamic overlays handled → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Platform Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Developer A: T006 (annotated template) + T007 (build_runner)
2. Once T007 done, distribute:
   - Developer A: T016, T017, T018 (JS logic in main controller)
   - Developer B: T008, T010 (iOS native + Dart controller)
   - Developer C: T009, T011 (Android native + Dart controller)
   - Developer D: T012, T013, T014, T015 (remaining platforms)
3. After US1 is testable, add US2 and US3

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- The JS overlay removal script is the core logic — all platform work is just property pass-through
- Commit after each task or logical group (after setup, after each story)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

---

## Phase 7: TDD remediation (from verification 2026-08-29)

**Purpose**: Address findings from `/speckit.tdd.verify` audit. The feature is **not done** until blocking findings are cleared.

### HIGH findings (blocking)

- [x] T037 [A3] Write integration test for dynamic late-loading overlays (SC-003). Inject a fixed overlay via `setTimeout` after page load, verify removal within retry window. Target: `integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart` add test case. Verify: `flutter test integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart --plain-name "dynamic" -d <device>`
- [x] T038 [A5] Write integration test for JS error non-propagation (SC-005). Inject JS that throws during overlay removal, verify web view remains responsive. Target: `integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart` add test case. Verify: `flutter test integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart --plain-name "error" -d <device>`

### HIGH findings (cross-platform coverage)

- [x] T039 [Cross-platform] Resolve macOS harness hang: investigate `pumpAndSettle` alternative or fixed-delay approach for macOS desktop WebView. Target: `integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart`. Verify: `flutter test integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart -d macos` — **PASSED `00:19 +4: All tests passed!`** after the WebView readiness gate (T040/T039 hinged on the same headless-WebView fix on this branch).
- [x] T040 [Cross-platform] Resolve Android `onWebViewCreated` timeout under `flutter test`. May require `flutter drive` or real device. Target: `integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart`. Verify: `flutter test integration_test/dismiss_dialogues_test.dart -d emulator-5554` — **PASSED `00:21 +4: All tests passed!`** on API-26 emulator after the readiness gate fixed `onWebViewCreated` firing under `flutter test`.

### MED findings (architecture & characterization)

- [x] T041 [Architecture] Decide: keep both `dismissDialogues` (brute-force) and `DialogueDismisser` (content-aware) as separate features, or wire `DialogueDismisser` behind the setting. Document decision in `spec.md` or new ADR. Target: `spec.md` or `docs/adr/`. Verify: manual review — **Resolved via `specs/002-dismiss-dialogues/adr-001-dismiss-dialogues-vs-dialogue-dismisser.md`: keep `dismissDialogues` (brute-force, spec contract, A1–A5) as shipped; `DialogueDismisser` stays intentionally unwired (semantics differ — content-aware vs remove-all — so wiring it would violate SC-002).**
- [x] T042 [U6] Add `mergeUserScripts` test for non-empty existing caller script list. Target: `test/dialogue_dismisser/dialogue_dismisser_test.dart`. Verify: `flutter test test/dialogue_dismisser/dialogue_dismisser_test.dart --plain-name "mergeUserScripts non-empty"`
