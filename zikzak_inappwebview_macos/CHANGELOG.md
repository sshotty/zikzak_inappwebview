## 6.1.0 - 2026-09-29


### Features

- [macOS] `InAppWebViewSettings.contentBlockers` is now actually applied. The setting was declared and decoded on macOS but never consumed — no `WKContentRuleList` was ever compiled or added, so ad/tracker blocking was silently inert while the identical setting works on iOS. `setSettings` now removes all content rule lists, serializes the decoded blockers, compiles them through `WKContentRuleListStore` under the shared `ContentBlockingRules` identifier, and adds the result to `configuration.userContentController`; an empty list clears blocking without compiling. Compilations are serialized with a token so a stale completion can no longer re-add rules a newer update removed, and a single `applyContentBlockers` funnel serves platform views, `InAppBrowser`, headless webviews and runtime updates (#338)
- [macOS] `useOnDownloadStart` / `onDownloadStartRequest` are now wired. macOS declared the setting and accepted the Dart callback, but no Swift code read the flag and no `WKDownload` plumbing existed, so the documented support could never fire. The package now adopts `WKDownloadDelegate`, returns `.download` from the navigation-response policy when the MIME type cannot be shown (with an iOS-style main-frame/non-text-mime fallback that dispatches the event and cancels), dispatches the event and cancels the native download from the destination callback so Dart streams the bytes, maps Dart policy `DOWNLOAD` to `.download` in `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`, bridges through `WebViewChannelDelegate`, and routes the event in the Dart controller. The action-stage handoff now reports a real `contentLength` and derives `suggestedFilename` from the URL path (#339, #340, #344)
- [macOS] `InAppBrowser` forwards `onDownloadStartRequest` to its event handler — downloads started in the browser never surfaced an event before (#344)
- [iOS/macOS] The platform-view root is now pinned to its Flutter bounds. On iOS `clipsToBounds` is set unconditionally at view setup; on macOS `layer.masksToBounds = true` is pinned at construction time (after `wantsLayer`, so the pin cannot be a silent no-op) and re-asserted after the web view is embedded. An `NSView` does not clip by default, so a native layer could paint over sibling Flutter content on a mis-clipped compositing path (#331, #336, #337)

### Bug Fixes

- [iOS] Forward private custom URL schemes to `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`. Payment and authentication deep links such as `weixin://` were cancelled by the native pre-navigation gate before the host navigation delegate ran, so a host could not intercept them and open the URL externally. The gate now blocks only what `URLValidationManager` already treats as dangerous (blocked schemes, failing scheme-specific checks, schemeless URLs, a rejecting custom validator); a custom scheme that no host policy handles is still cancelled
- [macOS] Stop an `EXC_BREAKPOINT` crash on macOS 15.x. `WKNavigationAction.sourceFrame` is declared non-optional by the Swift overlay, but WebKit can deliver a nil runtime object, and member access then traps in the unconditional Objective-C bridge. Navigation source frame and request/security origin are now read through a KVC-based accessor that yields nil for a nil runtime frame, at both the `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` and `onCreateWindow` call sites. With a present frame the emitted map is unchanged; with a nil frame Dart receives `sourceFrame: null`, which `NavigationAction`/`CreateWindowAction` already model as nullable (#327)
- [Dart] `onDownloadStartRequest` tolerates a null arguments map and drops a URL-less payload instead of throwing out of `DownloadStartRequest.fromJson` (#344)
- [iOS] The pre-navigation gate and `URLValidationManager` no longer evaluate a custom scheme twice — one scheme policy returns an explicit block / defer-to-host / allow decision that is reused as the delegate fallback, so a host custom validator runs once per navigation. The fallback stays fail-closed

### Internal

- Every macOS parity gap above is guarded by source-contract and behavioral tests runnable on any host (`content_blockers_parity_test`, `content_blockers_rule_list_test`, `download_start_request_parity_test`, `swift_sourceframe_kvc_test`, `swift_platform_view_clipping_test`, `ios_custom_scheme_navigation_test`)
- `InAppWebView`/`WebViewChannelDelegate` param-listener tests hardened: `handleMethod` now proves a decoded download event reaches the params callback and that a malformed one is dropped
- Bug and feature records for #327, #331, #337, #338, #339 and the iOS custom-scheme navigation fix live under `.specify/bugs/`, with TDD cycle logs and verification reports

### Docs

- Record the macOS WKWebView passkey requirements (web credentials entitlement, `apple-app-site-association` host, document-focus gotcha) in INSIGHTS.md
- Upstream engine report for the Flutter 3.47.x platform-view overlay compositing artifact filed as [flutter/flutter#193363](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/193363), with an on-device mitigation matrix and evidence frames under `.specify/bugs/flutter347-platformview-rendering/`

### Example

- Add a WebAuthn passkey test page plus a local relying-party host, wired into the macOS example drawer, for manual passkey validation

---

## 6.0.1 - 2026-09-11

### Bug Fixes

- [iOS] Make `InAppWebView.evaluateJavaScript(_:completionHandler:)` portable across Xcode versions. Its completion handler was declared `@MainActor @Sendable (Any?, (any Error)?) -> Void`, which only matches the SDK bundled with recent Xcode. On older SDKs the method stopped overriding its superclass and the extra overload it left behind made every single-argument `evaluateJavaScript(...)` call ambiguous — 10 compile errors, meaning consumers on older Xcode could not build the iOS plugin at all
- [Web] `consoleLogEnabled: false` now actually disables console interception. The guard read `params.webviewParams?.settings`, a field that does not exist on `PlatformWebViewCreationParams` — it is `initialSettings` — so the web implementation did not compile either
- [iOS] Declare `dataStoreWasSelected` in the scope shared by the iOS 9 and iOS 11 availability blocks in `preWKWebViewConfiguration`; it was declared inside the iOS 9 block but read by the later cookie-setup block, so the file did not compile (#316, #329)
- [iOS] Remove two always-true `!= null` guards in `HttpAuthCredentialsDatabase` and an unused `dart:typed_data` import in its screenshot/PDF delegation test

### Internal

- CI passes end to end again, now 15 jobs. `flutter analyze` runs with `--no-fatal-infos`: compile errors and warnings fail the build, style-level infos do not
- `zikzak_inappwebview_ios` joined the analyze and test matrices, and a `build-ios` job compiles its Swift sources from this checkout — that job is what surfaced the `evaluateJavaScript` breakage above
- Fixed `constant_identifier_names` in `zikzak_inappwebview_platform_interface/analysis_options.yaml` — `linter: rules:` accepts only booleans, so `ignore` left the rule enabled and produced 558 findings
- Intra-repo dependencies resolve from local source through `dependency_overrides`, so CI exercises this checkout rather than the published artifacts

- [macOS] Restore `userContentController` public access to satisfy WKScriptMessageHandler protocol conformance (#314)

### Features

- Add `consoleLogEnabled` setting (default `true`) — when `false`, the console override script is not injected and console.log/error/warn messages are NOT forwarded to Dart. Wired on all 4 platforms that intercept console: macOS, iOS, Android, Web

### Chores

- Exclude generated platform dirs from analyzer

## Unreleased

### Fixes

- Enable WebAuthn / passkey sign-in on macOS (#272): wire the `webAuthenticationSupport` setting into the native `WKWebViewConfiguration` (via KVC, `boundKeychainForPasskeys = true` when `WebAuthenticationSupport.FOR_APP`), matching the iOS wiring. The configuration is immutable after `WKWebView` init, so the setting is applied in the `init` config builder, guarded by `#available(macOS 13.3, *)`. Also adds the `getRealSettings` read-back so `PlatformInAppWebViewController.getSettings()` reports the effective value. Note: the host app still needs the `webcredentials:` Associated Domains entitlement and the site must serve a valid `apple-app-site-association`.
- Harden the WebAuthn/passkey wiring (#272 follow-up): guard the KVC `boundKeychainForPasskeys` write/read with `responds(to:)` against unexpected SDK states and log a warning when `webAuthenticationSupport` is changed through `setSettings` (creation-time only, as documented).

## 5.1.2 - 2026-08-24

### Fixes

- Implement `pressKey` in the macOS platform controller so the `PlatformInAppWebViewController.pressKey` API works on macOS (previously referenced but never implemented at the platform level).
## 5.1.1 - 2026-08-24

* chore: regenerate zorphy entity files for zorphy 2.3.0
* chore: restore dev path deps and bump zorphy/zorphy_annotation to ^2.3.0
* Prepare for publishing version
## 5.1.0 - 2026-08-24


### Fixes

- [Android] Remove deprecated `WebSettingsCompat.setRequestedWithHeaderOriginAllowList` / `getRequestedWithHeaderOriginAllowList` calls (marked for removal in `androidx.webkit`). Eliminates the `[removal]` build warnings introduced in 5.0.0. The Dart `requestedWithHeaderOriginAllowList` setting is retained for API compatibility (#235)
- [platform_interface] Correct the stale `in_app_webview_settings.dart` import in `PlatformSettingsDelegate` — the published 5.0.1 artifact shipped a broken relative import that broke every consumer; the source on `master` is corrected (`in_app_webview_settings` moved to `lib/src/domain/entities/`) (#249, #255, #257)
- [docs] Document the JavaScript bridge global rename to `window.zikzak_inappwebview` (was `window.flutter_inappwebview`) in the migration guide (#258)
## Unreleased

### Fixes

- [macOS] Prevent `addJavaScriptHandler` callbacks from crashing when their
  JSON-encoded result is a top-level value such as `null`, a string, or a
  number. The native bridge now consumes the JSON text already encoded by
  Dart instead of passing it through `JSONSerialization` a second time.

## 5.0.1 - 2026-08-22

### Fixes

- Fixed Android enum settings serialization so platform-channel consumers receive the expected integer wire values.

## [Unreleased]

## 5.0.0 - 2026-08-16

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated the entire `platform_interface` model layer to **Zorphy entities** — every model class is now a Zorphy entity instead of a hand-written `@ExchangeableObject`-style class (Phases 1–3j). This changes the public API surface of the platform interface (class structure, `toJson`/`fromJson`, equality) and may require updates to custom platform implementations.

### Features

- [platform_interface] Migrated model families to Zorphy entities: JS dialogue, ajax request, fetch request, console message, web resource, permission/safe-browsing, navigation, auth/ssl, pull-to-refresh, web storage, web message, web authentication session, context menu, webview environment, chrome safari browser, print job, `InAppBrowserMenuItem`, tracing settings, user script, image/rect/screenshot config, in-app webview settings, and script HTML tag attributes

### Chores

- Removed the dead `@ExchangeableObject` codegen toolchain
- Removed the Docusaurus website (to be replaced by a zread wiki)

## 4.10.0 - 2026-08-16

### Fixes

- [iOS] Gate `HeadlessInAppWebView.run()` on web-process readiness — the first real `loadUrl` after `run()` could be silently dropped by WKWebView while its content process was still booting, surfacing as "Unable to fetch data" on the very first request. `run()` now completes only after the initial navigation reaches a terminal state (`didFinish`/`didFail`); signal-driven, no timeout constant
- [iOS] Guard `run()` against a missing web view (no silent hang)
- [Android] Same headless readiness gate — `run()` completes only after `onPageFinished` or a main-frame error (both `InAppWebViewClient` and `InAppWebViewClientCompat`)
- [macOS] Same headless readiness gate — `run()` completes only after `didFinish`/`didFail`
- [Linux] Same headless readiness gate — the headless "run" channel handler responds only after the first `WEBKIT_LOAD_FINISHED`

### Features

- [example] Add First-Load Race Stress screen — reproduces the first-load race for headless and visible webviews (fresh webview + immediate `loadUrl`, 10 sequential attempts)

## 4.9.0 - 2026-08-14

### Features

- Session recipe — record and replay user sessions in the WebView: JS
  tap-listener injection, selector-candidate extraction, scripted click replay,
  and recipe models (#216)
- Navigation tracker — JS-assisted URL-cycle tracking through the webview (#216)
- Dialogue dismisser — inject JS to auto-dismiss modal dialogs (#216)
- Navigation guards — `keepNavigationInWebView` helper that keeps user-tapped
  links inside the WebView, avoiding iOS universal-link handoff (#216)
- [Windows] Virtual host name to folder mapping — CORS-safe serving of local
  folders (CORS bypass for local resources) (#185)
- [macOS] Popup windows — `window.open` / `target=_blank` now load their URL
  via `WKUIDelegate createWebViewWith` off-screen-window support, reparented
  into a Flutter platform view when `onCreateWindow` is handled (#182, #183, #187)

### Fixes

- [macOS] Popup window crash, settings key, and event delivery fixes (#187)
- [macOS] Network Capture API callbacks never fired — JS bridge name aligned
  with iOS/Android so `onNetworkRequest` / `onNetworkResponse` /
  `onNetworkLoadingFinished` reach Dart (#182)
- [Linux] Blue screen instead of webview — offscreen rendering via
  `GtkOffscreenWindow` + software rendering, plus `openDevTools` support (#184)
- [Linux] Native plugin compile regression — broken `takeScreenshot` string
  literal and missing include path (#179)
- Chore: renamed remaining `flutter_inappwebview` residuals to
  `zikzak_inappwebview` (JS bridge name, method channel, platform view type id) (#186)
- Chore: dependency bumps (npm deps, brace-expansion) (#189, #210)

## 4.8.0 - 2026-08-14

- [macOS] Implement print page support reusing the iOS pattern (#190, fixes #188)
- [Android] Add window-insets control for web content (`setInsetsForWebContentToIgnore` equivalent) (#206, fixes #198)
- [iOS] Add `UIScrollView` bouncesHorizontally / bouncesVertically (iOS 17.4+) (#209, fixes #199)
- [Android] Bump toolchain — androidx.webkit 1.15.0, AGP 8.13.1, JVM target 17 (#211, fixes #201)
- Refactor: split `InAppWebViewController` into domain-specific controllers (#176)
- Refactor: standardize dispose patterns across all wrapper classes (#175)

### Fixes

- [macOS] Await `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` response so cancellations are honored (#202, fixes #192)
- [macOS] Use `WKWebpagePreferences.allowsContentJavaScript` instead of deprecated `WKPreferences.javaScriptEnabled` (#212, fixes #200)
- [macOS] Replace deprecated `javaScriptEnabled` read in `getSelectedText` (#213)
- [macOS] Repair SPM build — duplicate `Util.swift`, iOS-only APIs, init ordering (#215)
- [macOS] Add missing `onPageCommitVisible` / `onDidReceiveServerRedirectForProvisionalNavigation` method-channel handlers (#217)
- [Windows] Forward `additionalBrowserArguments` to WebView2 (#214, fixes #178)
- [Windows] Implement `addJavaScriptHandler` + JS bridge (fixes #177)
- [Android] Use `androidx.core.view.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` type directly (#217)

## 4.7.0 - 2026-07-29

## Unreleased

- Renamed remaining flutter_inappwebview residuals to zikzak_inappwebview
  (JS bridge name, method channel and platform view type id)

## Unreleased

- Fixed macOS: popup windows (window.open / target=_blank) never loaded their
  URL. Added WKUIDelegate createWebViewWith support: the popup webview is
  created in an off-screen NSWindow (required for navigation to start on
  macOS) and reparented into a new Flutter platform view when onCreateWindow
  is handled by the app.
- Fixed macOS: Network Capture API callbacks never fired — the JS bridge was
  exposed as `window.flutter_inappwebview` while iOS/Android and the Network
  Capture interceptor use `window.zikzak_inappwebview`, so captured events
  never reached the Dart side (fixes `onNetworkRequest` / `onNetworkResponse` /
  `onNetworkLoadingFinished`)

### Features

- Added iOS proxy support (iOS 17.0+) — set process-wide proxy for WKWebView
- Added Network Capture API — capture XHR/fetch requests and response bodies
- Added Network Capture Scraper example screen

### Fixes

- Fixed: Web/WASM build failure — `HeadlessInAppWebViewWeb.dispose()` missing
  `isKeepAlive` parameter that was added to `PlatformHeadlessInAppWebView.dispose`
  interface, causing `dart2wasm` and `dart2js` compile errors
- Fixed iOS: removed duplicate `else` clause in `ProxyManager` guard statement
- Fixed iOS: added missing Flutter import and fixed Swift API usage in `ProxyManager`
- Fixed Linux: removed unused `<iostream>` includes and call `load_initial` in
  `createHeadless`
- Fixed Linux: fixed pre-existing C++ issues in `in_app_webview.cc`
- Fixed: restored `Disposable` interface on `PlatformProxyController`

### Chores

- Removed network capture example from public package
- Added `.clangd` and `compile_flags.txt` for Linux Flutter header resolution
- Bumped svgo dependency

## Unreleased

- Fixed: macOS media-capture permission prompts were missing - the `WKUIDelegate`
  did not implement `requestMediaCapturePermissionForOrigin`, so any page calling
  `getUserMedia()` (camera/microphone) was silently denied on macOS. Ported the
  iOS implementation to macOS (gated `@available(macOS 12.0, *)`): the delegate
  now dispatches `onPermissionRequest` to Dart with the `PermissionResourceType`
  (`camera` / `microphone` / `cameraAndMicrophone`) and maps the returned
  `PermissionResponse.action` (`GRANT` / `DENY` / `PROMPT`) back to
  `WKPermissionDecision`, defaulting to `.deny` if Dart returns no action. Also
  implemented the sibling `requestDeviceOrientationAndMotionPermissionForOrigin`
  for parity with iOS. Added the supporting `PermissionRequest` /
  `PermissionResponse` / `StringOrInt` types and `WKFrameInfo` /
  `WKSecurityOrigin` `toMap()` extensions (ported from iOS). Documented the
  required `NSCameraUsageDescription` / `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` Info.plist
  keys and `com.apple.security.device.camera` / `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`
  entitlements, and added a `getUserMedia()` test button to the example app.
  Closes #195
- Fixed: macOS `webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate` now implemented on the
  `WKNavigationDelegate` — when WebKit kills the content process (memory
  pressure, crash) the `onWebContentProcessDidTerminate` callback now reaches
  Dart and the WebView auto-reloads after 500 ms (mirrors the iOS behavior from
  #154), instead of leaving a blank/unrecoverable WebView. Closes #194
- Fixed: macOS `InAppBrowser` now forwards `onWebContentProcessDidTerminate`
  to the `InAppBrowserEventHandler`, matching the standalone WebView path

## 4.6.3 - 2026-07-21

- Fixed: Web/WASM build failure — `HeadlessInAppWebViewWeb.dispose()` missing
  `isKeepAlive` parameter that was added to `PlatformHeadlessInAppWebView.dispose`
  interface, causing `dart2wasm` and `dart2js` compile errors

## 4.6.2 - 2026-07-21

- Fixed: Web/WASM compilation broken by unconditional `dart:io` import in platform
  interface — replaced with conditional export `if (dart.library.io)` to compile
  a stub on Web/WASM and the real `HttpServer`-based implementation on native

## 4.6.1 - 2026-07-21

- Fixed: iOS compile error in `URLValidationManager` integration — removed extraneous
  argument label `url:` from `validateURL` call that caused Swift compiler error
  when archiving for device

## 4.6.0 - 2026-07-21

- Fixed: iOS InAppBrowser crash after SPM migration — storyboard now loaded via
  `Bundle.module` instead of main bundle, resolving "Could not find a storyboard
  named 'WebView'" exception when opening the in-app browser
- Fixed: Android WebView lifecycle — `onFlutterViewDetached()` now properly
  destroys the WebView (guarded against keepAlive)
- Fixed: Android WebSettings OEM crash protection — 18 `WebSettingsCompat.*`
  calls wrapped in try/catch for Huawei/Honor/OnePlus devices
- Fixed: iOS `webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate` now auto-reloads after
  500ms with `isDisposed` guard
- Fixed: iOS `URLValidationManager` wired into navigation flow — blocks
  `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `jar`, `wyciwyg` schemes at native level
- Fixed: `InAppLocalhostServer` race condition — added `Completer` gate to
  prevent `SocketException: Address already in use` on rapid start/close
- Fixed: `PullToRefreshController` — added `_isDisposed` guard with
  `MissingPluginException` catch
- Fixed: Headless WebView cleanup — explicit `stopLoading()` and script
  removal in deinit/dispose across iOS, Android, and Dart layers
- Fixed: webkit2gtk-4.0 compile failure with proper memory cleanup
- Feature: Web platform — added `addJavaScriptHandler`/`removeJavaScriptHandler`/
  `hasJavaScriptHandler` via `postMessage` bridge
- Feature: Windows — wired `WebViewEnvironmentSettings.userDataFolder` into
  WebView2 initialization with writability verification
- Security: iOS native URL scheme validation via `URLValidationManager`
- Perf: CookieManager — all 7 methods wrapped with `Lock.synchronized()` for
  thread-safe concurrent access

## 4.5.3 - 2026-07-20

- Fixed: iOS InAppBrowser crash after SPM migration — storyboard now loaded via
  `Bundle.module` instead of main bundle, resolving "Could not find a storyboard
  named 'WebView'" exception when opening the in-app browser
- Cleaned up `any` version constraints from dev/example pubspec files

## 4.5.3 - 2026-07-20

- Fixed: iOS InAppBrowser crash after SPM migration — storyboard now loaded via
  `Bundle.module` instead of main bundle, resolving "Could not find a storyboard
  named 'WebView'" exception when opening the in-app browser
- Cleaned up `any` version constraints from dev/example pubspec files

## 4.5.2 - 2026-07-19

- Fixed: Generator no longer produces `InvalidType` for fields referencing
  other generated types (e.g. `PrintJobColorMode?`) — the `exchangeable_object_generator`
  now falls back to AST source text when the analyzer can't resolve a type
- Feature: Added camelCase convenience getters for all `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
  enum constants (e.g. `UserScriptInjectionTime.atDocumentStart`,
  `Sandbox.allowPopups`, `ConsoleMessageLevel.warning`)
- Fixed: `exchangeable_enum_generator` no longer attempts to generate getters
  for Dart reserved words (`default`, `switch`, etc.) or `@ExchangeableEnumCustomValue`
  fields with non-standard types
- Docs: Added `GENERATOR_NOTES.md` documenting the `console_message.g.dart`
  null-safety hand-edit and regeneration workflow

## 4.5.1 - 2026-07-19

- Fixed: macOS `addJavaScriptHandler` bridge now uses `postMessage` with a JSON
  string instead of structured clone — eliminates `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` crash in
  WebCore's `wrap<DOMException>` when passing large or complex data through
  `callHandler`
- Fixed: macOS `evaluateJavascript` now returns `null` to Dart instead of
  throwing `PlatformException` when WKWebView returns `nil` (e.g., for
  `undefined`, `void`, or Promise expressions)
- Fixed: macOS `initialUserScripts` parameter was silently ignored — WKWebView
  now properly injects user scripts during initialization
- Added: `UserScriptInjectionTime.atDocumentStart` and `atDocumentEnd`
  convenience getters (in addition to existing `AT_DOCUMENT_START` / `AT_DOCUMENT_END`)
- Removed: CocoaPods podspec files from iOS and macOS packages (project is now
  100% SPM)

## 4.5.0 - 2026-07-18

- Feature: Added `addJavaScriptHandler` / `removeJavaScriptHandler` /
  `hasJavaScriptHandler` support on macOS — the JavaScript bridge
  (`window.flutter_inappwebview.callHandler()`) is now fully functional,
  enabling bidirectional communication between Dart and JavaScript in
  macOS WKWebView
- Fixed: macOS `ConsoleMessage.fromMap` crash when receiving null `message`
  or `messageLevel` values from JavaScript — fixed at the Swift native layer
  (coerces null to empty string), Dart macOS controller (null-safe constructor)
  and shared `ConsoleMessage.fromMap` (null-safe defaults for all platforms)
- Tests: Added unit tests for macOS controller (`addJavaScriptHandler` lifecycle)
  and platform interface (`ConsoleMessage.fromMap` null safety)

## 4.4.5 - 2026-07-18

- Fixed: macOS InAppWebView no longer returns WKWebView directly as the platform
  view — it now wraps it in a container NSView with proper autoresizing masks,
  eliminating the blank screen caused by a zero-frame WKWebView that couldn't
  resize to fill its allocated space
- Fixed: macOS example app entitlements — added missing
  `com.apple.security.network.client` to both DebugProfile and Release
  entitlements, granting WKWebView's networking process outgoing access so it
  can load remote web pages under App Sandbox
- Updated: Flutter SDK upgrade with project configuration migration across all
  platforms (Android build.gradle → build.gradle.kts, iOS SceneDelegate, Xcode
  project updates, platform file regeneration)

## 4.4.4 - 2026-07-03

- Fixed: macOS headless WebView now uses a dedicated off-screen `NSWindow` instead
  of attaching to the main window with `alphaValue = 0.01` — eliminates potential
  mouse event interception behind the Flutter surface while still providing the
  view hierarchy `WKWebView` needs for rendering and JS execution

## 4.4.3 - 2026-06-24

- Fixed: iOS JavaScript handler error messages with newlines, backslashes, or
  carriage returns are now properly escaped via `JSONSerialization` instead of
  single-quote interpolation that produced `SyntaxError: Unexpected EOF` and
  left JS promises pending forever — matches Android's `JSONObject.quote()`

## 4.4.2 - 2026-06-19

- Fixed: Windows and Linux `onWebViewCreated` type mismatch — platform controllers
  (`InAppWebViewWindowsController`, `LinuxInAppWebViewController`) are now wrapped through
  `controllerFromPlatform` to return proper `InAppWebViewController` instances

## 4.4.1 - 2026-06-16

- Fixed: Android build failure — `URLRequest` constructor calls in `InAppWebViewClient`,
  `InAppWebViewClientCompat`, and `InAppWebViewChromeClient` now pass the 5th `timeoutInterval`
  parameter to match the updated constructor signature

## 4.4.1 - 2026-06-16

- Fixed: Android build failure — `URLRequest` constructor calls in `InAppWebViewClient`,
  `InAppWebViewClientCompat`, and `InAppWebViewChromeClient` now pass the 5th `timeoutInterval`
  parameter to match the updated constructor signature

## 4.4.0 - 2026-06-16

- Feature: Android URLRequest now supports `timeoutInterval` — the InAppWebView will stop
  loading after the specified interval, making rendered HTML available for extraction via
  `getHtml()` even if the page hasn't fully loaded
- Feature: macOS `URLRequest` native extension with full property support —
  `init(fromPluginMap:)` and `toMap()` covering method, body, headers, cache policy,
  network service type, timeout interval, and more
- Refactor: macOS `InAppWebView` uses the new `URLRequest(fromPluginMap:)` extension
  for cleaner URL loading in both initial load and `loadUrl()`
- Chore: `prepare_for_publish.sh` no longer attempts to update CocoaPods podspecs
  (migrated to Swift Package Manager)
- Chore: Updated dependency lock files

## 4.4.0 - 2026-06-16

- Feature: New `URLRequest` native extension with `init(fromPluginMap:)` and `toMap()` —
  supports method, body, headers, cache policy, network service type, timeout interval,
  and more (replaces inline URL construction)
- Refactor: `InAppWebView` uses the new `URLRequest(fromPluginMap:)` extension
  for cleaner URL loading in both initial load and `loadUrl()`

## 4.3.8 - 2026-06-15

- fixed macos setting and removed pods from example
- 'updated deps'

## 4.3.7 - 2026-06-15

## 4.3.5 - 2026-06-12

- Fixed: macOS build failure — removed stray `}` that closed the `InAppWebView` class prematurely,
  leaving `WKNavigationDelegate`/`WKUIDelegate` methods outside the class scope. Also removed
  dead `result` variable reference from `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` (#145)
- Fixed: Android AGP 9+ build failure — replaced `getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt')`
  with `getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt')` in `android/build.gradle` (#143)
- Fixed: Linux build failure with WebKitGTK 2.52+ — migrated deprecated
  `webkit_web_view_run_javascript` → `webkit_web_view_evaluate_javascript` and replaced
  removed synchronous `webkit_web_view_get_snapshot` with async version (#142)
- Fixed: Windows build failure — removed `pluginClass` from pubspec.yaml; the Windows plugin
  is Dart-only (uses `webview_windows` package), so no native CMake project is needed (#142)
- Fixed: CMake include directory visibility for Linux plugin — changed `INTERFACE` to `PUBLIC`
  so the plugin can find its own headers (#142)

## 4.3.4 - 2026-06-12

- Fixed: iOS `type 'int' is not a subtype of type 'WebAuthenticationSupport?'` crash in
  `getHtml()`/`getSettings()` — `InAppWebViewSettings.fromMap()` now converts
  `webAuthenticationSupport` via `WebAuthenticationSupport.fromNativeValue()` instead of
  assigning the raw `int` value from the platform channel map

## 4.3.3 - 2026-06-04

-

## 4.3.2 - 2026-06-04

- fix: use KVC for webAuthenticationSupport to avoid SDK availability issue

## 4.3.1 - 2026-06-04

  native `WKWebViewWebAuthenticationSupport.boundKeychainForPasskeys` on iOS 16.4+ (#131)
- Fixed: macOS 26 crash in AppKit NSToolbar when InAppBrowser window closes — added
  `isClosing` guard and `window?.delegate = nil` before teardown (#87)
- Fixed: macOS WebView native frame drift with fractional platform view widths —
  overrode `layout()` to explicitly sync frame from superview bounds (#93)
- Fixed: iOS `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` deadlock when adding custom headers — added
  `isNavigatingWithCustomAction` flag to prevent re-entrant navigation callbacks (#132)
- Fixed: `InAppLocalhostServer` fails after app resumes from background — added
  `AppLifecycleListener` to close and reset server state on resume (#113)
- Fixed: `build_runner` fails due to missing `generators` package — added as dev_dependency
  in platform_interface pubspec (#139)
- Feature: `WebAuthenticationSession` now supports `additionalHeaderFields` for custom
  HTTP headers — available on iOS 17.4+ (#100)
- Chore: Raised minimum Flutter version from 3.29.0 to 3.38.6 for iOS touch fix (#128)

## 4.3.0 - 2026-06-03

- Fixed: iOS `onCreateWindow` not respecting client return value — now returns `nil` when
  the client handles the window creation, preventing WebKit from creating an unused
  window WebView (#107)
- Fixed: iOS crash on `InAppWebView.dispose()` when KVO observers fire after disposal —
  added `isDisposed` guard to `observeValue`, made `dispose()` idempotent with
  `isDisposed = true`, added `dispose()` call in `deinit` (#120, #129)
- Fixed: macOS SIGSEGV crash in `callAsyncJavaScript` — added `isDisposed` guard to
  `observeValue`, added optional chaining on `channel?.invokeMethod` calls (#126)
- Chore: Updated minimum iOS build version to 16.0

## 4.2.4 - 2026-06-03

- Chore: Added `generators` dependency to platform_interface for proper code generation

## 4.2.3 - 2026-06-03

- Fixed: Android onWebViewCreated not firing on ~50% release cold starts — deferred JS bridge
  registration (addJavascriptInterface, addDocumentStartJavaScript) to View.post() so binder IPC
  doesn't suppress engine's onPlatformViewCreated dispatch
- Fixed: Changed dismissDialogues setting default from true to false (opt-in behavior)
